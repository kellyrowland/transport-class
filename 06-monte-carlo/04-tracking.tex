\begin{frame}{Sampling Distance to Collision}

Collisions are probabilistic
\begin{itemize}
  \item Note that $\Sigma_t$, the total macroscopic cross section, will be a function of space if we have multiple materials
  \item Along a particular path, the \textit{probability of a collision at distance $s$} from the start:
    \begin{align*}
    p_c(s)ds &= \Sigma_t(s) e^{-\Sigma_t(s) s} ds \\
    P_c(s) &= \int_0^s \Sigma_t(s) e^{-\Sigma_t(s) s'}ds' = -e^{-\Sigma_t(s) s'} |_0^s = 1 - e^{-\Sigma_t(s) s}
  \end{align*}
  %\item This is the probability of interaction per unit distance $\times$ probability of traveling $s$ without interacting
%  \vspace*{0.5 em}
%  \pause
  \item The cross section, $\Sigma_t(s)$, is piecewise constant, \underline{but changing}
%  \item Integrating along path: CDF is piecewise
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Sampling Distance to Collision}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Variable transformation: measure distance in units of \textit{mean free path}:
  \[n = \Sigma_t(s)s\:,\quad dn = \Sigma_t(s)ds\]
  \item We'll start with the PDF and integrate to get the CDF
 \begin{align*}
    p_c(n)dn &= e^{-n} dn\\
    P_c(n) &= \int_0^n e^{-n'}dn' = -e^{-n'} |_0^n = 1 - e^{-n}
  \end{align*}
  \item Importantly, this is now \underline{independent of the material}

Randomly sample to determine number of mean free paths until next collision, $n_c$

  \vspace{.5em}
  \item $G(n_c) dn_c = 1 - e^{-n_c}$ 
  \vspace{.5em}
  \item Directly invert to get: $\boxed{n_c = - \ln(1 - \xi)}$ \\
   \hspace*{1.5em} [note $(1-\xi)$ is equivalent to $\xi$]
  \vspace{.5em}
  \item In the absence of material boundaries ($\Sigma_t \neq f(s)$), the distance to a collision, $s_c$, is
  \[s_c = \frac{n_c}{\Sigma_t}\]
